Women with endometriosis suffer from frequent symptoms despite multiple treatments in tertiary care. We aimed to investigate the effects of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) in women with deep endometriosis who remain symptomatic despite undergoing conventional medical treatment. A randomized controlled trial was performed with 2 groups: a standard medical treatment plus bMBI program and only standard medical treatment as a control. 
 In this part of the project, we develop the randomized controlled trial data cleaning, primary and sensitivity analyses code using R software.
